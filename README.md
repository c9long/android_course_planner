# CS346 Course Planner Android Project
## Instructions to Install
First, we need to set up the server. Within an Android emulator, such as Android Studio, navigate to the folder where you would like to install our application, open your terminal, and enter the following command:

`git clone https://git.uwaterloo.ca/dgrinton/cs346-project.git`

Once the repository is cloned, open the repository in your emulator. Ensure that a folder named `.idea` does not exist in the project directory. Navigate to the server directory in the repository. Navigate to `src/main/java/com.example.server/Application.kt`. There is a small green "play" button next to the main function, denoted by `fun main()`. Click that button and select 'Run ApplicationKt.'

Drag the APK from its installed location onto your emulated device. It will now work properly.

Navigate to the latest available release below, or using the link to view all software releases [here.](https://git.uwaterloo.ca/dgrinton/cs346-project/-/tree/main/release) Download the latest installer APK, and drag onto your emulated Android device.
